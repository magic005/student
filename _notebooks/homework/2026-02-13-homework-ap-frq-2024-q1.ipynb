                "I structured the `Feeder` class to maintain the `currentFood` state. For the daily simulation, I prioritized the 5% bear check using `Math.random()`. If that didn't trigger, I calculated the bird consumption by generating a random value in the 10-50 range and multiplying by the number of birds. In the multi-day simulation, I used a loop that checks the food level at the start of each day to decide whether to increment the count and run the simulation.\n",

                "\n",
                "My main difficulty was ensuring the multi-day loop didn't count a day when the feeder was starting at zero. I initially put the `simulateOneDay` call before the check, which gave me an extra day in the results. I had to rethink the order so that the \"finding food\" condition was checked at the very beginning of the loop iteration.\n",

                "## Final result\n",
                "\n",
                "Testing showed that the feeder drains correctly and the day count accurately reflects how many days the visitors found food. The 5% bear chance also correctly resets the food to zero when it hits\n",
