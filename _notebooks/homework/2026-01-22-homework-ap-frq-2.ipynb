                "I went through the instructions step-by-step. The first thing I read was that the constructor required two parameters, a string for the name of team 1 and a string for the name of team 2. I initialized these string properties at the top of the class and then assigned them to values in the constructor.\n",
                "\n",
                "Then, I noticed that I needed to implement a feature that would switch between active teams. I thought the easiest way to do this was to create a boolean, because there's only two possible things that could happen: either team 1 is active, or team 2 is active. So, I added a boolean property called `isTeam1Turn`, which is initially true but will change later on.\n",

                "The next step I took was to create the `recordPlay()` method. I noticed that the method should do something differently whether the argument is 0 or if it is a positive integer. So, I first made an in statement to check if the argument was equal to zero. If it is, then I would change which team's turn it is. Otherwise, I would add the points to the active team's score. I did this by using another if statement to see which team's turn it was, and then adding the points to the respectiv variable.\n",
                "\n",
                "Lastly, I created the `getScore()` method. This one was easy because it was just string manipulation. All I had to do was separate each team's score with a hyphen. I used a ternary at the end to see which team is currently active, and then append that team's name to the end of the string.\n",
