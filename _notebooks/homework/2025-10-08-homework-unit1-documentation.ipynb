    "### Part 3: Reflection Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 1: Why is documentation more important in team projects than solo projects?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Documentation is significantly more critical in team projects for several key reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Communication Across Developers:**\n",
    "   - In solo projects, you're the only person who needs to understand your code\n",
    "   - In team projects, multiple developers need to understand and use each other's code\n",
    "   - Documentation serves as a communication bridge, explaining intent without requiring direct conversation\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Different Perspectives and Assumptions:**\n",
    "   - What seems \"obvious\" to one developer may not be clear to another\n",
    "   - Documentation makes assumptions explicit and clarifies design decisions\n",
    "   - Helps prevent misuse of methods due to misunderstanding their purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Onboarding New Team Members:**\n",
    "   - New developers can quickly understand existing code through documentation\n",
    "   - Reduces the time needed for training and code walkthrough\n",
    "   - Allows teams to scale more efficiently\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Parallel Development:**\n",
    "   - Team members can work on different modules simultaneously\n",
    "   - Documentation defines interfaces and contracts between modules\n",
    "   - Enables integration without constant communication\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Long-Term Maintenance:**\n",
    "   - In teams, different people may maintain code over time\n",
    "   - Original developer may not be available to explain their code\n",
    "   - Documentation preserves institutional knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Code Review Process:**\n",
    "   - Well-documented code is easier to review\n",
    "   - Reviewers can focus on logic rather than deciphering purpose\n",
    "   - Speeds up the review and approval process\n",
    "\n",
    "While documentation is helpful in solo projects (especially for your future self), it becomes **essential** in team environments where clear communication and shared understanding are critical for project success.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 2: Give an example of when a method SHOULD be documented and when it SHOULD NOT.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SHOULD BE DOCUMENTED Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "/**\n",
    " * Calculates the weighted average of student grades across multiple categories.\n",
    " * \n",
    " * Uses the formula: Σ(category_average × category_weight) + extra_credit\n",
    " * where category weights must sum to 1.0 for accurate results.\n",
    " * \n",
    " * Preconditions:\n",
    " * - grades map must not be empty\n",
    " * - weights map must contain entries for all grade categories\n",
    " * - all weights should sum to 1.0\n",
    " * \n",
    " * @param grades map of category names to list of scores\n",
    " * @param weights map of category names to their weights (0.0-1.0)\n",
    " * @param extraCredit additional points to add (can be 0.0)\n",
    " * @return the calculated final grade (0.0-100.0+)\n",

    "    // Complex calculation logic here\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it SHOULD be documented:**\n",
    "- Complex algorithm that isn't immediately obvious\n",
    "- Multiple parameters with specific requirements\n",
    "- Important preconditions about data structure\n",
    "- Mathematical formula that needs explanation\n",
    "- Potential for misuse if requirements not understood\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**SHOULD NOT BE DOCUMENTED Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",

    "    return age;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it SHOULD NOT be documented:**\n",
    "- Simple getter/setter methods with obvious functionality\n",
    "- Method name clearly describes what it does\n",
    "- No complex logic or special cases\n",
    "- No parameters (for getter) or single obvious parameter (for setter)\n",
    "- Adding documentation would just repeat what the code already says\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Key Principle:**\n",
    "\n",

    "- Logic is complex or non-obvious\n",
    "- There are important preconditions or postconditions\n",

    "- The method is part of a public API\n",
