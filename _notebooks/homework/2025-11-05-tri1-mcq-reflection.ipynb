    "### Question 30: Nested Conditional in minOfThree\n",
    "\n",
    "**Topic:** Selection and Iteration (2.4, 2.9)  \n",
    "**Time Spent:** 1:16  \n",
    "**My Answer:** B  \n",
    "**Correct Answer:** D  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Problem\n",
    "Write code to replace `/* missing code */` in a method that returns the minimum of three integers:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public static int minOfThree(int a, int b, int c)\n",
    "{\n",
    "   /* missing code */\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why I Was Wrong\n",
    "I selected Option B:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "if (a <= b)\n",
    "{\n",
    "   if (a <= c)\n",
    "   {\n",
    "      return a;\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   else if (b <= c)\n",
    "   {\n",
    "      return b;\n",
    "   }\n",
    "}\n",
    "else \n",
    "{\n",
    "   return c;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The feedback correctly identified the flaw: **when a = 20, b = 10, and c = 30, this code returns 30 instead of the minimum value of 10.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me trace through this logic:\n",
    "1. `if (a <= b)` → `if (20 <= 10)` → FALSE\n",
    "2. We jump to the `else` block\n",
    "3. `return c;` → returns 30\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is that when `a > b`, we automatically return `c` without checking if `b` is less than `c`. This is a critical logical error.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Correct Answer: Option D\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "if (a <= b && a <= c)\n",
    "{\n",
    "   return a;\n",
    "}\n",
    "else if (b <= a && b <= c)\n",
    "{\n",
    "   return b;\n",
    "}\n",
    "else \n",
    "{\n",
    "   return c;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this works:** This uses compound boolean expressions with the AND operator (`&&`) to ensure:\n",
    "- `a` is returned only if it's less than or equal to BOTH `b` AND `c`\n",
    "- `b` is returned only if it's less than or equal to BOTH `a` AND `c`\n",
    "- If neither of those conditions is true, then `c` must be the minimum\n",
    "\n",
    "**Testing with the counterexample:**\n",
    "- a = 20, b = 10, c = 30\n",
    "- First condition: `20 <= 10 && 20 <= 30` → FALSE\n",
    "- Second condition: `10 <= 20 && 10 <= 30` → TRUE\n",
    "- Returns `b` (10) ✓\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Takeaway\n",
    "When finding minimum/maximum values among multiple variables, **both conditions must be checked simultaneously using AND logic**, not nested if statements that might skip comparisons. The pattern is: \"X is the minimum if X ≤ all other values.\"\n",

    "### Question 39: Recursive Binary Search\n",
    "\n",
    "**Topic:** Recursion and Searching (4.17)  \n",
    "**Time Spent:** 0:42  \n",
    "**My Answer:** A  \n",
    "**Correct Answer:** (Not explicitly shown, but based on the code logic)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Problem\n",
    "Given a recursive binary search implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public static int binarySearch(int[] elements, int low,\n",
    "                               int high, int target)\n",
    "{\n",
    "   if (low <= high)\n",
    "   {\n",
    "      int mid = (high + low) / 2;\n",
    "      if (target < elements[mid])\n",
    "      {\n",
    "         return binarySearch(elements, low, mid - 1, target);\n",
    "      }\n",
    "      else if (target > elements[mid])\n",
    "      {\n",
    "         return binarySearch(elements, mid + 1, high, target);\n",
    "      }\n",
    "      else if (elements[mid] == target)\n",
    "      {\n",
    "         return mid;\n",
    "      }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   return -1;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the value of `result` after executing:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int[] numbers = {10, 10, 10, 20, 20, 30, 40, 50, 50, 60, 80};\n",
    "int result = binarySearch(numbers, 0, numbers.length - 1, 10);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why I Was Wrong\n",
    "I selected Option A (-1), thinking the method would return -1 when the target wasn't found. However, the feedback states: \"The binarySearch method will return -1 only if target does not appear in elements between indices low and high, inclusive.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Since 10 DOES appear in the array (at indices 0, 1, and 2), the method should NOT return -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tracing the Correct Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's trace through the binary search for target = 10:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initial call:** `binarySearch(numbers, 0, 10, 10)`\n",
    "- `low = 0, high = 10`\n",
    "- `mid = (0 + 10) / 2 = 5`\n",
    "- `elements[5] = 30`\n",
    "- `target (10) < elements[mid] (30)` → TRUE\n",
    "- Recursive call: `binarySearch(numbers, 0, 4, 10)`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Second call:** `binarySearch(numbers, 0, 4, 10)`\n",
    "- `low = 0, high = 4`\n",
    "- `mid = (0 + 4) / 2 = 2`\n",
    "- `elements[2] = 10`\n",
    "- `target (10) < elements[mid] (10)` → FALSE\n",
    "- `target (10) > elements[mid] (10)` → FALSE\n",
    "- `elements[mid] (10) == target (10)` → TRUE\n",
    "- **Returns 2** ✓\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Takeaway\n",
    "The correct answer is **C (1)** or **D (2)**, depending on which occurrence the binary search finds. Since binary search finds the middle element first, it would return index 2 in this case. \n",
    "\n",
    "My error was:\n",
    "1. **Rushing through the problem** (only 42 seconds spent)\n",
    "2. **Not tracing through the algorithm** step by step\n",
    "3. **Misunderstanding when -1 is returned** (only when element is NOT in array)\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with recursive algorithms, especially binary search, it's crucial to **trace through at least 2-3 recursive calls** to understand the flow.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Reflection and Improvement Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Went Well\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Strong fundamentals** across all units with 95% overall accuracy\n",
    "2. **Excellent time management** - completed 42 questions in 82 minutes with time to spare\n",
    "3. **Confidence with data structures** - ArrayLists, arrays, and 2D arrays were handled quickly and accurately\n",
    "4. **Perfect scores** on Units 1 and 3 demonstrate solid understanding of Java basics and OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Needs Improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tracing through logic carefully** - Both mistakes could have been avoided by:\n",
    "   - Writing out test cases on paper\n",
    "   - Tracing through conditional branches systematically\n",
    "   - Not rushing even on \"simple\" looking problems\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Compound boolean expressions** - Need to practice:\n",
    "   - When to use `&&` vs nested if statements\n",
    "   - Testing edge cases with multiple conditions\n",
    "   - Understanding the order of evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Recursive algorithms** - Should practice:\n",
    "   - Drawing recursion trees\n",
    "   - Tracing at least 2-3 recursive calls\n",
    "   - Identifying base cases and recursive cases clearly\n",
    "\n",
    "### Action Items\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the actual AP exam, I will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a checklist for conditional problems:**\n",
    "   - [ ] Identify all possible paths through the code\n",
    "   - [ ] Test with at least 2-3 different input sets\n",
    "   - [ ] Check boundary conditions\n",
    "   - [ ] Verify each boolean condition independently\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Practice recursive tracing:**\n",
    "   - Complete 10 more recursive problems from past AP exams\n",
    "   - Draw out the call stack for each one\n",
    "   - Focus on binary search, merge sort, and recursive helper methods\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Review compound boolean logic:**\n",
    "   - Practice converting nested if statements to compound conditions\n",
    "   - Understand De Morgan's Laws thoroughly\n",
    "   - Work through more minOfThree-style problems\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Time management strategy:**\n",
    "   - For questions under 1 minute: double-check before moving on (like Q39)\n",
    "   - For questions over 5 minutes: ensure I'm not overthinking\n",
    "   - Flag questions for review if uncertain\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Scoring 40/42 (95.2%) on this practice exam is a strong result, but the two mistakes highlight important areas for growth. Both errors stemmed from **not thoroughly tracing through logic** - whether conditional branches or recursive calls. \n",
    "\n",
    "The good news is that these are **skill-based errors, not knowledge gaps**. I understand the concepts; I just need to develop better problem-solving habits:\n",
    "- Slow down on \"simple\" problems\n",
    "- Always trace through with concrete examples\n",
    "- Write out test cases before selecting an answer\n",
    "\n",
    "With Unit 1 and Unit 3 at 100%, and Units 2 and 4 in the low-to-mid 90s, I'm on track for a strong AP exam performance. The key is to continue practicing these tracing skills and maintain the same level of focus across all question types.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next steps:** Work through another practice exam in 2 weeks, focusing specifically on nested conditionals and recursive algorithms. I'll also create a \"common mistakes\" sheet to review before the actual exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, I'm pleased with this performance and feel confident moving forward with targeted practice in my weaker areas!\n",
