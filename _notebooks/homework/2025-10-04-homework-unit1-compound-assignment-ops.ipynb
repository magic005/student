    "## Homework Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compound Assignment Operators Used:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Operator | Usage in Program | Purpose |\n",
    "|----------|------------------|----------|\n",
    "| `+=` | `totalCalories += 450` | Add calories from meals |\n",
    "| `-=` | `totalCalories -= 400` | Subtract calories burned from exercise |\n",
    "| `*=` | `stepCount *= 2` | Double step count on extra active days |\n",
    "| `/=` | `weeklySteps /= 7` | Calculate average daily steps over a week |\n",
    "| `%=` | `weekProgress %= 7` | Keep week progress within 0-6 range |\n",
    "| `++` | `workoutDays++` | Increment workout day counter |\n",
    "| `++` | `waterIntake++` | Increment water glass counter |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Application:\n",
    "\n",
    "This fitness tracker demonstrates how compound assignment operators make code:\n",
    "- **More readable** - Intent is immediately clear\n",
    "- **More maintainable** - Less chance of typos\n",
    "- **More professional** - Follows industry best practices\n",
    "- **More efficient** - Variables evaluated once instead of twice\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Meaningful variable names** - Clear purpose for each variable\n",
    "**Print statements after each operation** - Shows progression\n",
    "**Detailed comments** - Explains what each operation represents\n",
    "**Complete simulation** - Models a full day of fitness tracking\n",
    "**Motivational feedback** - Provides encouraging messages based on progress\n",
    "**Multiple compound operators** - Uses all required operators (+=, -=, *=, /=, %=, ++)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Concepts Demonstrated:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Integer Division** - `weeklySteps /= 7` truncates to integer result\n",
    "2. **Modulus for Boundaries** - `%=` keeps values within range (0-6 for week days)\n",
    "3. **Increment Operators** - `++` is shorthand for adding 1\n",
    "4. **Accumulation** - Using `+=` to build running totals\n",
    "5. **Reduction** - Using `-=` to subtract from totals"
